! First, enter the energetic window in eV (relative to the Fermi level):
COHPStartEnergy -10
COHPEndEnergy 5
!
! Then, specify which types of valence orbitals to use:
includeOrbitals s p d
! You can also specify the basis functions per element manually, e.g.:
! basisFunctions Ga 4s 4p
! basisFunctions Sr 5s 4s 4p ! Sr_sv potential
!
! Now define the pairs for which COHP analysis etc. should be done.
! The atoms are numbered as per order in the PAW-code control file.
cohpBetween atom 45 atom 31
!
! If you are interested in single orbital COHPs, you can get all the pairs
! like s-s, s-p_x, ..., p_z-p_z. Uncomment this line to switch it on:
! cohpBetween atom 1 atom 2 orbitalWise
!
12
! If you want to generate the COHP pairs automatically, use this to include
! all pairs in a given distance range (in Angstrom, not in atomic units):
! cohpGenerator from 1.4 to 1.5
! cohpGenerator from 1.4 to 1.5 type Ga type Sr
! and in the latter case only between the specified elements
